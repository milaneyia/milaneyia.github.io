Beatmapping World Championship 2021 - Official Documentation (osu!standard)\r\n\r\n## Website\r\n\r\n### Introduction\r\n\r\nFor this edition of the osu! Beatmapping World Championship, we are using a website in order to make things easier to manage. All important information will be posted on it, including the judging sheets, the .osz submission, etc... The website will also register your country flag, which will be very important for the registration and voting phase.\r\n \r\n**The website uses osu! official API and will not collect private information. Only your osu!id, your mappers/captain application, your flag and the content of the judging sheets for judges will be kept.**\r\n\r\n### Registration\r\n\r\nThe registration of your team will be done through the website, please note that you (or your teammates) don’t need to have any ranked mapsets to register your team or participate in the contest. Please be aware that the country you’re applying for is the one displayed on your osu! profile. \r\n\r\nOn the registration form, you’ll be asked to write down your team name, the Team Captain of your team and the list of your entire team with their osu! UID (the number right after /users/ on someone’s userpage). *No more edits of your team will be allowed once the deadline is passed.*\r\n\r\nYour team name should abide by the following so as to avoid occurences:\r\n- it shouldn't be inappropriate or insulting\r\n- it should fit under 16 characters\r\n- it shouldn't contain non-standard/unicode characters\r\n\r\n### .osz Submission\r\n\r\nTo submit your entry, the Team Captain will submit the entry through the website. The submission process will remain the same during the whole contest. Please note that you are allowed to edit your submission as long as the deadline is respected.\r\n\r\nThe Team Captain will be the only person to have access to the team’s submission page (unless special circumstances) and will be the first person to be contacted by the Staff members if needed. \r\n\r\n*No delays will be tolerated (except for specific circumstances).*\r\n\r\n### Judging Sheets\r\n\r\nJudges will have their own interface on the website where they can visit and edit their judging sheets for each round. The judging sheets will be visible only for Judges and the Staff. The scoring, votes and comments on each entry will be revealed at the end of the judging phase of each round. \r\n\r\n## Contest Format\r\n\r\n### Contest Rounds\r\n\r\nThere are 4 rounds in total for this contest.  A team must participate at least 3 rounds (this means 3 rounds of valid submissions) to be eligible to win any prize.\r\n\r\nThere is no limit on the number of teams registered from one country. However, at the end of Round 1, if a country has multiple teams successfully participated this round, only the team with highest score will proceed to the next rounds as other teams from this country will be eliminated.\r\n\r\nA typical round consists of 3 sections: the mapping section, the judging section and the showcase section.\r\n\r\n- Mapping section: The team is able to select **1** out of **2** songs announced at the beginning of the mapping section.\r\n- Judging section: Entries submitted by teams will be anonymized and sent to the Judges for review and score. \r\n- Showcase section: When all the scores are collected from Judges, map submissions of this round will be displayed via showcase.\r\n\r\n*Note: Only the First Round results (teams that can proceed and teams that will be eliminated) will be announced during its showcase section. The results of succeeding rounds will remain confidential until the contest concludes. This is to encourage teams staying in this contest till the end and not get unexpectedly impacted by intermediate results.*\r\n\r\n### Players' Pick\r\n\r\nA new prize makes its appearence in the osu! Beatmapping World Championship this year, the **Players' Pick**. A batch of 5 professional players (above #5000) will vote under specific judging criteria for their favorite entries among all the entries starting at Round 2. Note that results of Players' Pick will not influence the mapper judges as described in the leaderboard section below.\r\n\r\n### Leaderboard\r\n\r\nIn this contest, there are two leaderboards corresponding to the two types of Judges. Leaderboard of scores from Player Judges or Mapper Judges are independent, i.e., not influenced by each other. Leaderboard illustrates the ranking of teams by their accumulated score in this contest, from highest to lowest. The accumulated score is calculated by summing the 3 highest scores out of 4 rounds obtained by the team in this contest. This is to encourage teams staying in this contest and provide opportunity for a comeback for the teams that may not do well in certain rounds.\r\n\r\n## Judging stage\r\n\r\nFor the first time in the osu! Beatmapping World Championship, we decided to put some spice in it. At the end of Round 1, results of which teams can proceed and which teams are eliminated will be announced. However, results and leaderboards during Round 2, 3, 4 will not be announced until the live stream showcase at the very end of this contest. This means that you will NOT know your scores of Round 2, 3 and 4. This is to encourage teams staying in this contest and not influenced by intermediate results or rankings. \r\n\r\n### Judges\r\n\r\n**Responsibility of Judges** - Judges are responsible for giving score and provide comments as feedback to the submitted entries during a round of the contest.\r\n\r\n**Selection of Judges** - Judges is this contest are selected by the contest hosts from the Judge applications.\r\n\r\n**Organization of Judges** \r\n1. Type: Judges have two types: Player Judge and Mapper Judge.\r\n2. Number: There are in total 14 Judges for this contest. \r\n3. Batch: Judges are separated into two batches by rotation, i.e. each batch is responsible for specific rounds. All batches have the same number of unique judges. The objective of judge rotation is to reduce the workload of Judges as well as adding diversity into the judging team.\r\n\r\n**Judging Criteria** - Judging Criteria vary between judge type.\r\n\r\n1. **Mapper Judge**:\r\n   - **Fundamentals** - This criterion will focus on the fundamental skills of mapping. A map can show the fundamental skills of mappers in different aspects, include, but not limit to: respect to the ranking criteria, completeness of hitsounding, style and pattern consistencies throughout the difficulty, reasonale fluctuations of difficulty according to the music and many more.  \r\n   - **Expertise** - This criterion will focus on the advanced skills, or expertise of mapping. A map with high expertise shows great management over note patterns, flows, movements, and even hitsounds. Those maps are outstanding compared with their peers in this contest and  mark themselves as top-tier in state-of-the-art mapping community.\r\n   - **Creativity** - This criterion will focus on the innovativeness of the entry. The history of osu!mapping is always shaped by creative maps, showing avant-garde or even ahead-of-time understanding of mapping. Creative yet solid maps are art of osu! and thus definitely promoted in this contest.\r\n   - **Judge's Impression** - This part is left to the Judges' sole discretion. Judges can use this for extra scores or penalties for their specific comments or remarks on something in the entry.\r\n\r\n2. **Player Judge**:\r\n   - **Sophistication**: This criterion will focus on how comfortable it is to play the beatmap, in accordance with its difficulty level. As much as they can be considered as pieces of art, beatmaps are defined to be in-game levels made for users to enjoy them. Therefore, for them to gain players' attraction, they need to be player-friendly first.\r\n   - **Profundity**: Players are supposed to rate the quality of the beatmap by looking at nothing else than its structure. Playing a super-simple jump/stream map might be fun, but we are here to have a competition here after all! Establishing complex mapping structures can take huge amounts of time and effort, so players need to take the profundities of beatmaps into account during their evaluation.\r\n   - **Uniqueness**: Throughout the history of osu!, we can see that beatmaps displaying unique patterns usually be the centre of community attention, and sometimes even become era defining masterpieces. With that in mind, we would like to draw players' attention to the artistic aspects of mapping and see where their opinions revolve around.\r\n   - **Player's Impression** - This part is left to the Players' sole discretion. Players can use this for extra scores or penalties for their specific comments or remarks on something in the entry.\r\n\r\n**Score** - Scores from judges will be standardized before adding to the leaderboard.\r\n\r\nFor each judge, scores will be standardized per the following method: The final score S* of a submission in the Qualifier Round is obtained by:\r\n    - S* = ( S - S(average) ) / SD\r\nin which S is the Original Score, S(average) is the average of all Original Scores that a judge has given throughout the round and SD is the standard deviation of all Original Scores that a judge has given throughout the round.\r\n\r\nSum of all the judges' standardized scores is the score the team will obtain in this round, and will be added to the leaderboard.\r\n\r\n### Contest rules\r\n\r\n1. **The [osu! Ranking Criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria/osu!) and [General Ranking Criteria](/wiki/Ranking_Criteria) are in effect for this contest.** The winning prize of the contest includes ranking the 3 beatmaps submitted by the winning teams, which we cannot get it done if the beatmaps do not abide by the Ranking Criteria. Any required difficulties to fulfill the requirements of the Ranking Criteria will be supplied by the [Organisation Team](#organisation). Inapplicable cases such as spread requirements are excluded from this rule.\r\n2. **3-6 members per team required.** The main concept of the contest is to exhibit the potential of each country, meaning that a collaboration of at least 2 members on each song will be required from the team members. How you organize the sections is completely up to you.\r\n3. **Each mapper must contribute at least once during the contest.** Since this is a country-based competition that requires teamwork, we would like to have each member of a team rewarded fairly for their diligence. Failing to help other teammates and letting them pull the strings is considered unsportsmanlike and may get you disqualified from the contest.\r\n4. **A team must participate in at least 3 rounds in order to be eligible for prizes.** We don't want our competitors to burn out, but we still want to reward the ones who deserve it.\r\n5. **Stealing or plagiarizing others' work is strictly prohibited.** Copying other users' intellectual properties is highly unethical and forbidden by the [Beatmap Submission Rules](/wiki/Rules#beatmap-submission-rules). If your submission is found to be plagiarized, your team will be disqualified from the contest immediately. \r\n6. **Uploading your submission through [BSS](/wiki/Submission) or sharing it on any third-party websites before the deadline is strictly prohibited.** This includes asking for external help, sharing the beatmap with users outside of your team. Violation of this rule will result in disqualification. We strongly recommend not revealing any related materials as well, such as photos and screenshots of your submission.\r\n7. **Entries can only be submitted through the official website.** This process is made to ease the management of the difficulties between the judges and the contestants. No entries will be accepted through any means other than the website. For any questions regarding using the website, please contact the hosts of the contest.\r\n8. **Submissions will not be accepted after the deadline.** As everybody will share the same time period to map for each round, extending the deadline for any particular team would be unfair for others. Therefore, any entries submitted after the deadline will not be taken into account. The website will automatically close submissions once the deadline has passed.\r\n9. **Custom hitsounds are allowed, but none will be provided.** You are allowed, and even encouraged, to use custom hitsounds. How you will organize them will be up to you.\r\n10. **Changing the contents of the provided `.osz` file is prohibited.** This includes changing the timing of the `.osu` file, replacing or removing the `.mp3` file, altering the metadata of tags, titles and artists as well. We would like to avoid any complications during the judging process, thus submissions containing altered mentioned values or contents will be considered invalid. \r\n11. **Do not include storyboards or beatmap backgrounds.** They will not be considered in the judging process and will be removed prior to entries being passed onto the judges.\r\n12. **Restricted users cannot take part in the contest.** For the legitimacy of this contest, restricted users are not allowed to participate. If a restricted user is identified to contribute to this contest in one team, the entire team will be disqualified.\r\n13. **Teams must consist of users from a single country only.** Merging or combining countries does not allow people to represent their individual country to the fullest. You can only join the team that belongs to the country displayed on your osu! profile.\r\n14. **Keep the organizers in touch with team updates past the preparation phase.** If a contestant has to drop out from the contest for any reason, please let the staff know about it as soon as possible. No replacements will be allowed and no rewards will be attributed to the user if the team achieves the top 3 or is nominated for the Player's Pick award. Users that quit the contest are not able to rejoin. If the number of participants drops below the required minimum, the team will be disqualified.\r\n\r\n### FAQ\r\n\r\n1. **What is this contest?**\r\n\r\n    The osu!
